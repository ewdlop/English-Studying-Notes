To create a sentence with diverse grammatical structures using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and assess it for grammar components, you can follow these steps:

1. Install NLTK and import necessary libraries.
2. Tokenize the sentence.
3. Tag each word with its part of speech to identify grammar components.

Here's an example:

```python
import nltk

# Ensure required NLTK components are downloaded
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

# Define a sentence that includes various grammatical components
sentence = "As the sun sets, the children, who had been playing in the park, quickly gather their toys and run home."

# Tokenize and tag the sentence
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)
tagged = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

print("Tagged Sentence with Parts of Speech:")
print(tagged)
```

This example will output the sentence with each word tagged by its grammatical part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, conjunction). Youâ€™ll see output like:

```plaintext
[('As', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ('sun', 'NN'), ('sets', 'VBZ'), (',', ','), ('the', 'DT'), ('children', 'NNS'), (',', ','), ('who', 'WP'), ('had', 'VBD'), ('been', 'VBN'), ('playing', 'VBG'), ('in', 'IN'), ('the', 'DT'), ('park', 'NN'), (',', ','), ('quickly', 'RB'), ('gather', 'VB'), ('their', 'PRP$'), ('toys', 'NNS'), ('and', 'CC'), ('run', 'VB'), ('home', 'NN'), ('.', '.')]
```

Explanation:
- **IN** = Preposition or subordinating conjunction
- **DT** = Determiner
- **NN** = Noun
- **VBZ** = Verb, 3rd person singular present
- **NNS** = Noun, plural
- **WP** = Wh-pronoun (who, what)
- **VBD** = Verb, past tense
- **VBN** = Verb, past participle
- **VBG** = Verb, gerund or present participle
- **RB** = Adverb
- **PRP$** = Possessive pronoun
- **CC** = Coordinating conjunction
