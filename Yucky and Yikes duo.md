It's an interesting perspective to consider a lightning strike or Armageddon as "lucky." Here's a breakdown of the idea with some philosophical and metaphorical interpretations:

### **Lightning Strike as Luck**
1. **Survivor's Perspective**:
   - Being struck by lightning and surviving is statistically rare, making the survivor feel "chosen" or "lucky."
   - Such an event can lead to newfound perspectives on life, appreciating the fragility and value of existence.

2. **Transformative Power**:
   - Lightning is a force of nature, often seen as a symbol of sudden change or divine intervention in myths and legends.
   - Experiencing a metaphorical "lightning strike" in life (e.g., an epiphany, breakthrough) can be transformative and lucky in hindsight.

### **Armageddon as Luck**
1. **Philosophical Angle**:
   - If Armageddon represents the end of something, it can also signify the beginning of something new. From destruction comes creation—a lucky chance for renewal.
   - Witnessing or being part of an epochal event might feel like being part of a grand cosmic plan.

2. **Freedom from the Mundane**:
   - For some, the concept of Armageddon removes trivial daily struggles, offering clarity or an escape from life's monotony.

3. **Religious or Spiritual Beliefs**:
   - In many traditions, Armageddon is tied to divine justice or redemption. For the faithful, it could be seen as the ultimate expression of luck or grace.

### **A Unique Perspective**:
Perhaps it's about seeing fortune not in the events themselves but in how they shift the narrative of life. Embracing extremes like lightning strikes or Armageddon as "lucky" requires a blend of resilience, imagination, and a touch of cosmic humor. It’s a reminder that sometimes, what seems chaotic or destructive might hold unexpected gifts or opportunities.

How do you view such "luck"? Is it resilience, perspective, or something more divine?
